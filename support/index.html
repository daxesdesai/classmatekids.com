        <h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What age group is Classmate designed for?</h3>
            <p>Classmate is designed for children in grades K-6, typically ages 5-12. The app automatically adjusts content difficulty based on the selected grade level.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Is Classmate free to use?</h3>
            <p>Classmate is free to download with a 3-day free trial. During the trial, you get full access to all features including Math Facts Drills, Word Problems, and Homework Help. After the trial, a subscription is required to continue using the app. There are no ads.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How does the Homework Help feature work?</h3>
            <p>Simply point your camera at any math problem, and Classmate will scan it using AI technology. The app then provides a step-by-step explanation with friendly voice guidance to help your child understand how to solve the problem.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Why isn't the app scanning my homework?</h3>
            <p>For best results when scanning homework:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensure good lighting on the page</li>
                <li>Hold the camera steady and frame the problem clearly</li>
                <li>Make sure the math problem is clearly written or printed</li>
                <li>Avoid shadows on the page</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How do I hear the voice explanations?</h3>
            <p>Make sure your device volume is turned up. When viewing a homework explanation, the app will automatically read each step aloud. You can also tap the speaker icon to replay any step.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Does Classmate work offline?</h3>
            <p>Math Facts Drills and Word Problems work offline. However, the Homework Help feature requires an internet connection to process images and generate explanations.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How do I change my child's grade level?</h3>
            <p>You can change the grade level at any time from the home screen. Simply tap on the current grade level selector and choose the appropriate grade for your child.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Is my child's data safe?</h3>
            <p>Absolutely. We take privacy seriously, especially for children. Classmate stores all practice data locally on your device, doesn't require account creation, and doesn't collect personal information. Read our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> for full details.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How do I delete my child's practice history?</h3>
            <p>You can reset practice history in the app settings, or simply uninstall and reinstall the app. Since all data is stored locally on your device, this will remove all stored information.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What devices does Classmate support?</h3>
            <p>Classmate is available for iPhone and iPad running iOS 15.0 or later. An Apple Silicon Mac can also run the app.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Can I use Classmate for multiple children?</h3>
            <p>Yes! You can change the grade level as needed for different children. Each child can practice at their appropriate level by simply selecting their grade before starting.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>The app is running slowly</h3>
            <p>Try closing other apps and restarting Classmate. If issues persist, restart your device. Make sure you have the latest version of the app installed.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Voice guidance isn't working</h3>
            <p>Check that your device volume is turned up and not on silent mode. Make sure you have a stable internet connection, as voice synthesis requires connectivity.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Camera won't open for Homework Help</h3>
            <p>Classmate needs camera permission to scan homework. Go to your device Settings > Classmate > Camera and make sure it's enabled.</p>
        </div>
